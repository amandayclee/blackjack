# Blackjack
Blackjack is a famous card game found in many casinos. It's a game where players try to get cards that add up to 21 without going over. In this version, you play against the computer, and we use two sets of cards.

Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository.

Ready to play some blackjack? [Let's get started!](https://amandayclee.github.io/blackjack/)

Here's how it works:

1. You'll begin with $1000 in your bankroll. Place a bet to receive your first two cards.
2. If you're dealt a soft hand (where one of your cards is an Ace), your options are stand or hit. For a hard hand (no Ace or Ace counted as 1), you have an additional choice - double your bet! But remember, if you double down, you can only hit one more time.
3. Once your hand is complete, the game determines the winner:
- Blackjack: Win your bet plus double the winnings.
- Win: Get back your bet plus your winnings.
- Lose: Say goodbye to your bet.
4. If you run out of chips or cards, simply reset the game and start again.
